/**
 * A wrapper around a byte array which supports unsigned integers.
 *
 * Since Java lacks support for true unsigned integers some conversion has
 * to be made before sending them to a system that expects unsigned values.
 * Non-integer data types are not directly supported but can be used by
 * calling getSubrange() and setSubrange() with the byte representation.
 *
 * There is one important thing to know when using this class. When you set
 * or get a value you need to store that in a variable that is at least one
 * step larger than the data type you use when you store it.
 *
 * See the following example where we create a two byte PDU and store a
 * value. We then retrieve the value again and prints it to the console.
 * Note that your PDU may probably be larger than two bytes and you may
 * want to store more than just one value. Use the offset argument when
 * setting values in your PDU in order to put them where you want them.
 *
 * int myValue = 32768;
 * PDU pdu = new PDU(2);
 * pdu.setShort(0, (short) myValue);
 * int myOtherValue = pdu.getShort(0);
 * System.out.println(myOtherValue);
 *
 * 32768 is too large for Java to keep in a short, so you need an int in
 * order to use it. However, ints in Java are 4 bytes and we want to store
 * it as an unsigned short using only two bytes. That's what the PDU class
 * can do for us.
 *
 * Once we want the data back from the PDU we need to store it as an int
 * again. This is important to know because the PDU class won't give you
 * unsigned types, but the representation of the data stored in the PDU
 * is unsigned so it can be extracted and sent as it is to something that
 * expects unsigned values.
 *
 * Changelog:
 *
 * 2010-10-01: Original version.
